# Arduino-Whistle-2-LED-ON-OFF
Arduino two LEDS ON OFF using microphone. You can activate it by short melodie simply whistling

DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------

This simple project require at least Arduino UNO R3 or Arduino Nano

Using a preamplified electret micropohone you can capture the sound around you and send it at A0 Arduino pin. Use also a 50K trimmer for volume regulation.
The source code analize the audio spectrum at 4Khz on a A0 pin. Setting a 3 notes (but you can change it as you like) for every way. When the sequence of the set notes is captured, Arduino can activate two different output for general purpose. In this example Arduino set ON and OFF two LEDs and nd sounds a buzzer with two different sequence.

Thanks for pay attention!
